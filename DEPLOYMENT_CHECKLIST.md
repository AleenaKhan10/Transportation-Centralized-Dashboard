```

### 2. Connect to Netlify
1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose your Git provider and repository
4. Use these build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Base directory**: (leave empty)

### 3. Set Environment Variables
Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables and add:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `DB_HOST` | `34.170.113.11` |
| `DB_PORT` | `3306` |

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Test These Endpoints:
- [ ] Main dashboard loads
- [ ] Slack Tickets page loads
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Analytics view displays data
- [ ] All view types (Chat, Table, Card, Timeline) work
- [ ] Database connection is successful

### Test API Endpoints:

- [ ] `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/slack-tickets/analytics`

## If Issues Occur

1. **Check Build Logs**: Netlify Dashboard > Deploys > View details
2. **Check Function Logs**: Netlify Dashboard > Functions > slack-tickets
3. **Test Database Connection**: Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. **CORS Issues**: Check console for API call errors

## Performance Notes

- Subsequent calls should be fast
- Free tier includes 125,000 function invocations/month
- Database queries are optimized with pagination

## Estimated Deployment Time

- Initial setup: 10-15 minutes
- Build time: ~2-3 minutes
- Total: 15-20 minutes

## Success Indicators

✅ Build completes successfully  
✅ Functions deploy without errors  
✅ Database connects successfully  
✅ Search returns results  
✅ All views render correctly  
✅ No console errors
